          WhatIs: San Francisco 49ers
        - Answer: Founded in 1898, this is the oldest, continuously playing, football team, first known as the "Morgan Athletic Club" in Chicago. In 1901, the team owner, Chris O'Brien, got a killer deal on a batch of used red football uniforms. The team manager thought they looked faded but O'Brien quickly corrected him by noting they were just a particular shade of red.
