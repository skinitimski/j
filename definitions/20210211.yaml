  Category: Great Pyramids of Egypt<sup>CAR TALK</sup>
  Answer: |
    In his youth, a man decides to take a trip to visit the great pyramids of Egypt. He is deeply moved by the trip, and years later he decides to take his son, who has never been away from home, to see the pyramids. Here's the catch. The man made his trip to the pyramids in 1995, but his son made his trip to see them in 1969. How is this possible?
  Question: The dates are in BC (BCE). The father took his trip in 1995 BC. And 26 years later in 1969 BC, he and his son went. Pretty good, huh?<br /><br /><em>Special thanks to NPR's Car Talk for this puzzler!</em>
