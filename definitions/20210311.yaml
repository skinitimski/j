    - Name: Mustelid Madness<sup>GG</sup>
      Description: |
        This category written by our very own Genevi&#xE8;ve Gagn&#x00E9; features different types of mustelid's (mammals of the weasel family).
      Trivia:
        - Answer: This mustelid is the domesticated form of the European polecat.  The history of the mustelid's domestication is uncertain, but it is likely that they have been domesticated for at least 2,500 years and were used by the Romans for hunting.  Caesar Augustus sent some of these mustelids to the Balearic Islands to control the rabbit plagues in 6 BC.  They are still used for hunting rabbits in some parts of the world, but increasingly they are kept only as pets.  Its name is derived from the Latin furittus, meaning "little thief", a likely reference to its penchant for secreting away small items.  Being so closely related to polecats, they easily hybridize with them, and this has occasionally resulted in feral colonies of hybrids that have caused damage to native fauna, especially in New Zealand.
          WhatIs: Ferret
        - Answer: This large, stocky mustelid weighs an average of 20-25 pounds and can be found all over Africa, Southwest Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.  It is notorious for its strength, ferocity and toughness. It is known to savagely and fearlessly attack almost any other species when escape is impossible, reportedly even repelling much larger predators such as lion and hyena.  Bee stings, porcupine quills, and animal bites rarely penetrate their skin.  If horses, cattle, or buffalo intrude upon their burrow, it will even attack them.  This fearless behavior gave rise to a popular YouTube meme video in 2011 where someone narrates over Nat Geo Wild footage while talking about how much this crazy, nastyass animal just doesn't care.
          WhatIs: Honey Badger
        - Answer: This large, seafaring mustelid is a marine mammal native to the coasts of the northern and eastern North Pacific Ocean. Adults typically weigh between 30-100 pounds, making them the heaviest mustelids, but among the smallest marine mammals. Unlike most marine mammals, this creature's primary form of insulation is an exceptionally thick coat of fur, the densest in the animal kingdom.  Although it can walk on land, it is capable of living exclusively in the ocean.  They are a classic example of a keystone species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest.  They keep the population of sea urchins in check, who graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing it to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem.  It is thought that they may help mitigate effects of climate change by this cascading dietary influence.
          WhatIs: Sea Otter
        - Answer: This is the largest land-dwelling mustelid, coming in around 20-30 pounds. It is a stocky and muscular carnivore, more closely resembling a small bear than other mustelids. A solitary animal, it has a reputation for ferocity and strength out of proportion to its size, with the documented ability to kill prey many times larger than itself.  This creature can be found mostly in remote reaches of the Northern boreal forests and subarctic and alpine tundra of the Northern Hemisphere.  In pop culture, this creature is the University of Michigan's mascot and the namesake of Marvel Comics character James "Logan" Howlett, who was given the name because of his short stature, keen animal senses, and ferocity.
          WhatIs: Wolverine
        - Answer: This tiny mustelid, averaging between only 6 to 9 ounces, is the subject of a famous Leonardo da Vinci oil painting, where one of an unusually large size rests in a lady's arms.  In Irish mythology, they were viewed anthropomorphically as animals with families, which held rituals for their dead.  They were also viewed as noxious animals prone to thieving, and their saliva was said to be able to poison a grown man.  To encounter one when setting out for a journey was considered bad luck, but one could avert this misfortune by greeting the mustelid as a neighbor.

        - Answer: A brand of cowboy hat, and the name of its company, the world's largest hatmaker known for hats such as the "Boss of the Plains" and the "Ten Gallon" model. The term "ten gallon" has nothing to do with the hat's liquid capacity, but derives from the Spanish word <em>gal&#xF3;n</em>, meaning <em>braid</em> -- ten indicating the number of braids used in the band of the hat. (given its size, it <em>may</em> actually hold ten gallons!)

        This category written by our very own Genevi&#xE8;ve Gagn&#x00E9; features different styles of famous hats.
      Trivia:
        - Answer: Archaeology and art history indicate that headgear similar to the modern version of this hat has been worn since the Bronze Age across Northern Europe and as far south as ancient Crete and Italy, where it was worn by the Minoans, Etruscans and Romans.  The hat's practicality has long made it an item of military, police, and other uniform clothing and can still be seen in widespread military use today.  It was famously worn by both Che Guevara and members of the Black Panther Party.
          WhatIs: Beret
        - Answer: This hat is the modern precursor to the "Pannonian cap," military headgear worn by soldiers in the late Roman Empire.  The modern version was invented by milliners in the 1930's and could be made out of wool, velvet, organdy, mink, lynx, fox, or leopard skin.  The leopard variety is also the subject of a satirical 1966 Bob Dylan song.  It was famously worn by both Jackie Kennedy and Meghan Markle.
          WhatIs: Pillbox Hat
        - Answer: This hat was said to have been designed in 1849 by London hat-makers Thomas and William, who gave the hat their family name.  It was designed as a special order for gamekeepers who needed close-fitting, low-crowned hats that could protect them from low-hanging branches on horseback.  It was called "the hat that won the West" by American journalist Lucius Beebe, since it was the most popular hat during the American frontier, beating out both the cowboy hat and sombrero in popularity at the time.  It was famously worn by both Charlie Chaplin and comedy duo Laurel & Hardy.
          WhatIs: Bowler Hat
        - Answer: This hat is a semi-formal hat of fur felt, characterized by a single dent running down the center of the crown (called a "gutter crown"), a wide silk grosgrain hatband ribbon, a flat brim shaped in a "pencil curl", and a ribbon-bound trim about the edge of the brim.  It is named after the German town that it comes from and originated there as hunting headgear.  It was popularized by Edward VII after he visited the town and brought back a hat of this style.  It was famously worn by Winston Churchill and Al Pacino's character Michael Corleone in 'The Godfather'.
          WhatIs: Homburg Hat
        - Answer: This hat is a narrow-brimmed type of hat, once viewed as the "rich man's favored hat", and was frequently seen at the horse races.  It was described as having a "shorter brim which is angled down at the front and slightly turned up at the back" compared to the fedora's "wider brim which is more level".  The hat's name derives from the stage adaptation of George du Maurier's 1894 novel of the same name.  Traditionally it was made from rabbit hair felt, but now is usually made from other materials, such as tweed, straw, heavyweight cotton, wool and wool/nylon blends. The hat reached its zenith of common popularity in the 1960s; the lower head clearance in American automobiles made it impractical to wear a hat with a tall crown while driving.  It was famously worn by both Frank Sinatra and Justin Timberlake.
