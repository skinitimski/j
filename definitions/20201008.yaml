  Answer: "This dance move created by James Brown in 1959 was popularized internationally after being named in the lyrics of Motown's first mega-hit \"Do You Love Me\" in 1962. The dance move begins by stepping backward with one foot with that heel tilted inward. The foot is positioned slightly behind the other (stationary) foot. With the weight on the ball of the starting foot, the heel is then swiveled outward. The same process is repeated with the other foot: step back and behind with heel inward, pivot heel out, and so on. The pattern is continued for as many repetitions as desired."
