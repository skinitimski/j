    - Name: Very Knotty<sup>JK</sup>
      Description: |
        This category features varieties of knots.
      Trivia:
        - Answer: This knot is named after the professionals who use it when preparing and selling fresh cuts of meat, especially for roasting, because it can be tied very quickly and wastes very little string because the knot can be tied while one end is still attached to the coil. <br /><img src="https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/butchers/butchersR9.jpg">
          WhatIs: Butcher's Knot
        - Answer: This simple knot is used as a snare to catch small animals. It is often confused with the more complex Hangman's Knot, which is related but more turns are wrapped around the loop. Like the Hangman's Knot, this knot can also be deadly; it should never be tightened around someone's neck because it can bind and critically restrict blood flow. Interestingly, laws in Louisiana and New York prohibit the display of this knot because of its use as a means of intimidation. While the Louisiana Bill specifies the Hangman's Knot version, the New York law does not. <br /><img src="https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/noose/nooseR7.jpg">

It's so hard, the greatest knot of all, so flexible and strong. but I do something wrong." <br /><img src="https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/truckers/truckersR11.jpg">
          WhatIs: Trucker's Hitch
        - Answer: This knot that is used to shorten a rope or take up slack should be avoided because it is known to fail even when tied correctly.  Boy Scouts used to be required to learn it but due to the use of modern "slippery" synthetic ropes, it is now replaced by a safer and stabler knot, such as the Alpine Butterfly Loop. (Literally, the word means "leg of a fleeced animal".) <br /><img src="https://www.animatedknots.com/photos/sheepshank/sheepshankR8.jpg">

      Trivia:
        - Answer: This 1976 sci-fi film directed by Michael Anderson and starring Farrah Fawcett depicts a utopian future society on the surface, but is actually a dystopia where population and resources are controlled by killing everyone who reaches the age of 30. Gene Siskel gave the film zero stars, calling it "unquestionably the worst major motion picture I've seen this year."
          WhatIs: Logan's Run
        - Answer: "This 1974 sci-fi film directed by John Boorman stars a young Sean Connery in a skimpy red outfit. It depicts a post apocalyptic world where barbarians worship an eponymous stone god who has the power to grant either death or eternal life and declares in the opening scene: \"The gun is good! The penis is evil!\". The director was inspired to write it after his adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkein's \"Lord of the Rings\" was declined."
          WhatIs: Zardoz
        - Answer: This 1976 sci-fi film directed by Nicolas Roeg follows an extraterrestrial, played by David Bowie, who crash lands on Earth seeking a way to ship water to his planet, which is suffering from a severe drought, but finds himself at the mercy of human vices and corruption.

In 2002, Steven Soderbergh wrote and directed an American adaptation of this film, starring George Clooney.
