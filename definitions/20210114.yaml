  Answer: |
    Dr. Margaret Todd gave science this word in 1913, which is a variant of a chemical element that is distinguished by the fact that it has a different number of neutrons but the same number of protons. Carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14 are all examples of this, since these variants have 6 protons like carbon is supposed to, but have different numbers of neutrons (6, 7, and 8 respectively). The word comes from the Greek words for “equal” and “place”, referring to the fact that these variants come from the same elemental foundation.
