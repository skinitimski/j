  Answer: "This animal (whose scientific name is fittingly the Ancient Greek word for prophet) has a bad rap. Only 30% of all mating sessions end with the female biting off the head of her mate and eating it. Only 30%. Interestingly, there are evolutionary advantages to this behavior (sexual cannibalism). The male’s brain, located in the head, controls inhibition, and a ganglion in the abdomen controls the motions of copulation. Without his head, the male will lose his inhibitions but continue mating, which means he can fertilize more of the female's eggs, thus passing on more on his genes and “winning” (evolutionarily speaking). The female? She gets a good meal."
