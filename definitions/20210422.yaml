  Answer: There's this unusual little bar, where you can get a free beer if you know the secret code. The secret code works like this. The bartender says a number; you tell him another number. If it's right, you get a free beer. For example, a customer goes up to the bar and the bartender says "6". The customer says "3" and he gets his free beer. <br/>The second fellow goes up to the bar, and the bartender says "12". The customer says "6" and he gets his free beer! A third customer sits at the bar, and the bartender says "14". The customer says "8". She gets a free beer. You're sitting at the bar. The bartender turns to you and says "22". What do you say to get your free beer?
