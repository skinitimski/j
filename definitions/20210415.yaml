    "Where Was I Gonna Go, Detroit?"<sup>JK</sup>
  Answer: In his epic poem "Paradise Lost", John Milton invented this word as the name of the capital city of Hell. Stemming from the Greek words for "all" and "little devil," the term roughly translates to something like "place for all devils." Milton invented the word to describe a truly unpleasant-sounding place, but when we use the word today, it usually refers to a kind of chaos. The OED defines it as "utter confusion, uproar; wild and noisy disorder."
